# librosa 0.11.0 has known issues with Python 3.13 related to removed standard library modules (aifc, sunau).
# It also pulls in an older numba/llvmlite that doesn't support 3.13.
# Upgrading to a newer librosa (if available and compatible with your code)
# or allowing uv to find the latest compatible version is key.
# As of current search results, librosa 0.11.0rc1 (and potentially the final 0.11.0 if released)
# is marked as supporting Python 3.13, but might require manual installation of `standard-aifc` and `standard-sunau`.
# For simplicity, let's try allowing uv to find the most recent librosa that supports Py3.13.

# Ensure numba and llvmlite are explicitly allowed to be the latest versions
# as they now support Python 3.13. uv will prioritize these if the constraints
# from librosa allow it, or it will try to find compatible versions of all.
